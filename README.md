The goal of this project is to understand vaccine distribution accross the US.

So far, I have worked on tidying the CDC data. 

This has included removing columns that either don't make sense or aren't important for us.
I ended deciding that we might need to separate the CDC data into separate dataframes:
1)one that contains the manufacturer information
2)one that contains general delivery/administration information

See "FinalProjectOrganizedCode.Rmd" for my work so far.

I also did some work on the shiny app UI but I think this will change depending on how we think about the data moving forward.
